utelnetd 0.1.4
==============

This is a small telnet daemon for standalone use, mostly on embedded
systems. 

Compile it by running 
  
  make

If you want to have more debug output during runtime, run 

  make DEBUG=1

The Makefile was written for Linux and BSD; to use it on BSD run make
with 

  gmake BSD=1

Any feedback is welcome!
